# Implementation reference

These are lifted from scipy, respectively from [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/f187aa25bbdd7023e9cdedb6c5da7f789742dcf8/scipy/stats/_continuous_distns.py#L1) for the Wilcoxon test and from [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/f187aa25bbdd7023e9cdedb6c5da7f789742dcf8/scipy/stats/_mannwhitneyu.py) for the Mann-Withney U test.

The code has been stripped to only leave the parts that interest us and can help debug our implementation.
