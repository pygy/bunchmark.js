mwu() (./src/mann-whitney.js) and wilcoxon() (./src/wilcoxon.js)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- The asymptotic p-value estimation and zero-correction is derived from SciPy
- Versions of their own implementation of `mwu()` and `wilcoxon()` are 
  also bundled in `./reference/*.py`, pared down to match the options
  we baked in.
